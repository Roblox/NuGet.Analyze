Intro
=====
NuGet.Analyze is a proof-of-concept of a NuGet extension meant to provide repository analysis functionality in terms of NuGet package dependencies.

Problem Statement
=================
Software Factories usually build and maintain frameworks and reusable components alongside their main products.
This requires proper change management.

Usually, this involves a dependency matrix document that project leads or architects create and maintain.

NuGet.Analyze is an attempt to automate this time consuming task, and provide you with a quick means to get a real-time view on all project's package dependencies.
